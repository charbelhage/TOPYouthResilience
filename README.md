## Enhancing Children's Resilience to Adversity in Puerto Rico

THE CHALLENGE – Supporting children’s resilience – their ability to bounce back in the face of adversity –
is critical to their wellbeing, including by helping avoid long-term negative mental health outcomes.
Create tools and resources designed specifically for Puerto Rican children and youth that promote
resilience, such as by addressing mental health stigma.

EXECUTIVE CHAMPION – Jennifer Cannistra, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Administration for
Children and Families, HHS

THE PROBLEM – COVID-19 and other disasters have exacerbated and shined a light on critical gaps in
behavioral health care for children and youth in the United States. All levels of government, as well as
many communities, youth, and families across the country, are focused on addressing this challenge. In
December 2021, the U.S. Surgeon General released an Advisory on Protecting Youth Mental Health, which
highlighted that rates of psychological distress among young people, including symptoms of anxiety,
depression, and other mental health disorders, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health
emergencies among young people have also increased. In 2020, there was a 24 percent increase in
emergency room visits for mental health reasons for children ages 5 through 11, and more than a 30
percent increase in such visits for those ages 12 to 17. Tools and resources to address stigma and
promote resilience in children and youth must be created in consultation and partnership with the end
user (children and youth) and must be culturally relevant and user friendly. Advancing equity in mental
health for children and youth in Puerto Rico is particularly pressing because of the significant exposure to
natural disasters, the impact of COVID-19 in the community, and the limited access to resources to
support and strengthen the mental health of children and youth.

THE OPPORTUNITY – Promoting resilience is particularly important for children and families who have
experienced and are at risk of experiencing disproportionate stress and trauma during the pandemic.
We believe there is an opportunity to create child- and youth-friendly tools that highlight
culturally-relevant and available resources, practices, and tools for children and youth in Puerto Rico to
build resilience and fill a critical gap.

VISION FOR SPRINT OUTCOMES – Through the creation and distribution of child- and youth-friendly tools
and resources specifically designed for the unique culture, language, and resources in Puerto Rico, more
children and youth in Puerto Rico could have access to new skills and resources to strengthen their
responses to adversity.

TARGET END USERS – Children and youth, parents, educators, community-based organizations, and other
service providers in Puerto Rico.
